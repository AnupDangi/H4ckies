# MediSync  

## Overview  

**MediSync** is an AI-powered drug interaction checker application designed to help users ensure the safe use of multiple medications by identifying and analyzing potential drug interactions. With the increasing complexity of medical prescriptions, particularly in patients with chronic conditions or those taking multiple drugs, understanding how medications interact is crucial to avoid adverse effects.  

## Project Goals  

This project aims to build an innovative, user-friendly solution that goes beyond standard drug interaction databases by incorporating:  

- **AI-driven interaction predictions**  
- **Health tracking**  
- **Real-time alerts**  

## How It Works  

Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), the MediSync app utilizes a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of known drug interactions, side effects, and pharmacological data. The AI system predicts interactions for newer or lesser-known medications, providing a safeguard even when the drugs are not fully documented in standard databases. This enables the app to offer dynamic interaction warnings and improve the accuracy of the interaction detection process.  

## Features  

- **Drug Interaction Analysis**: Identify potential interactions between multiple medications.  
- **AI Predictions**: Get predictions for newer or lesser-known drugs.  
- **Health Tracking**: Monitor health metrics related to medication use.  
- **Real-time Alerts**: Receive immediate notifications about potential interactions.
